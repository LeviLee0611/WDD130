      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        Is it necessary to rent a car to travel? -The answer will be different depending on where you are traveling, but we would say the answer is NO. Most places in the downtown area of Korea are easy to get to by using public transportation. Korea is one of the countries with good public transportation, so you can easily find buses, subways, and taxis wherever you go, and it is arranged so that foreigners can easily find the way. Especially if you plan to travel in the city, it will be faster to use public transport due to heavy traffic.

        Korea has a long history more than 4000 years. From the beautiful palace where the king stayed in the past, the walls and buildings that protected it can still be seen here and there today. In Seoul, the largest city in Korea, modern buildings can be seen centered on the palace. Experience the beauty of the coexistence of the old and the modern!
